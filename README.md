## 🧠 Detection and Recommendation of Autism Spectrum Disorder using Python Machine Learning
## 📜 Description
This project aims to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and provide personalized recommendations based on predicted results. It is built using **Jupyter Notebook and Streamlit** for real-time interactivity and machine learning.

## ✨ Features
1️⃣ **Register or Sign-in Page**: User authentication and session management.
2️⃣ **Homepage**: Educational content and information about ASD.
3️⃣ **Dashboard Page**: Displays insightful statistics over 5 years:
   - Gender-based statistics.
   - Jaundice statistics.
   - Childhood Autism Rating Scale.
   - Family Member with ASD statistics.
   - Social Responsiveness Scale.
4️⃣ **Form Page**: Interactive AQ-10 questionnaire for ASD assessment and ML-based prediction with recommendations.
5️⃣ **Contact Page**: Contact information for user assistance and support.
6️⃣ **Results Page**: Visual pie chart of model accuracy and prediction outcomes.

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions
1. ⬇️ **Clone the repository**.
2. 📦 **Install required packages** using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage Instructions
Run the following command to start the application:
```
streamlit run register.py
```

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**, containing various medically relevant features for ASD detection.
🤖 Model Details
✅ **Algorithms Used**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression.
✅ **Feature Scaling Techniques**: Standard Scaler and Normalization.

## 📈 Results
🎯 **Accuracy Achieved**:
- SVM: 69%
- Logistic Regression: 70%

## 📚 Publication
📝 This project was submitted for publication in the **Vietnam Journal of Computer Science**. Although it was initially considered, it was later rejected — but the learning from the review process has significantly improved the project for future submissions.
